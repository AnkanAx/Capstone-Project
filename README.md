# Capstone-Project

This project is part of the Data Science Specialization Course from Coursera. The aim of the project is to build a predictive application for the next word. The smart keyboard offered by [**SwiftKey**] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/swiftkey?activetab=pivot_1%3aprimaryr2) is seen as a role model for the project.

The datasets used for the project consists of text data from blog, news and twitter messages. It can be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip

The major features in the project consist of building a library of word sequences ([**n-grams**] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)), construction of a prediction model along with publishing it on [**Shinyapps**] (https://www.shinyapps.io).
